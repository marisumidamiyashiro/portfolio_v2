                        <p>For this project I was assigned the task of designing three book covers inspired by the
                            narratives of the “This is Criminal” podcast, hosted by Phoebe Judge, with the intention of
                            creating a trilogy. I chose to listen to “How to Sell A Haunted House,” “Ian Manuel,” and
                            “Sanctuary” as the episodes to base my designs on.</p>

                            didn't worry about how I would be tying each book cover together. Instead, I wanted to
                            ensure that each design conveyed what the story might be about.</p>
